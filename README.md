# Drum Kit Web Application

This is a simple Drum Kit web application that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. The project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file used to style the webpage.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for playing drum sounds.
- `images/`: The folder containing images used in the webpage (e.g., `in.jpg`).
- `README.md`: This file provides information about the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click on the drum buttons or press the corresponding keys (`x`, `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) on your keyboard to play the drum sounds.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Keyboard Support**: Play drum sounds using your keyboard.
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons provide visual feedback when clicked or when corresponding keys are pressed.

## Customization

- You can change the images, fonts, and styles by modifying the `styles.css` file.
- The drum sounds can be changed by editing the `index.js` file and replacing the audio sources.

## Dependencies

- The project uses Google Fonts (`Arvo`) for the font styling. The link to the font is included in the `index.html` file.
